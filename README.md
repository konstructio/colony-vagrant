# `colony-vagrant`

This is a set of Vagrant files and scripts to provision a virtual datacenter to try out the Colony project in Civo Cloud, as well as aiding with the development of the project.

## Quickstart

* We provide a [`make` command to bootstrap an environment](./docs/quickstart-make.md) using Civo Cloud to try Colony before its 1.0 release; or
* We provide a manual, step-by-step guide to [bootstrap an environment](./docs/quickstart-manual.md)

## Development

* [Development helpers](./docs/development.md): Additional help for developing with `colony` and connecting vscode to the `datacenter` and `laptop` machines.
* [k3s server agent](./docs/k3s_server_agent.md): All the information related to `k3s` server and agent setup.
